Hurtigruten: Minutt for Minutt
This remarkable program is drawn from the award-winning, Guinness record-breaking 134 hour live broadcast documentary, titled Hurtigruten: Minutt for Minutt and produced in 2011 by NRK, Norway’s national broad- caster. So overwhelmingly popular, it was viewed by more than half the Norwegian population - even the Queen of Norway!

A Norway Passage: The Most Beautiful Voyage is the story of a voyage along more than 1,100 miles of Norway’s spectacular coastline on the Hurtigruten ship Nordnorge.
